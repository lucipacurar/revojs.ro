**Change really is the only const**, even when it comes to the event venue, signed and payed for.

## The short version

We've signed the contract for the **Multifunctional Hall** of the **Timis County Council (CJT in short)** as the venue of revo.js 6 months before the event. We've payed the total amount of the contract on the 9th of September, about 1 month before the event.

3 days later we get an unofficial call from a representative of CJT telling us that the venue is double booked during the same dates.

How can something like this happen?  
How come that even with a contract and a fully payed invoice we were "invited" to look for a different venue?

## The long story

We have scouted for the revo.js venue more than 1 year in advance and decided to go with the Multifunctional Hall of the Timis County Council, which suited us pretty well:

- it accommodates around 250-300 participants, which was exactly our target for this first edition;
- you could arrange the chairs in any way you want;
- it has a nice and a bit unconventional architecture which allowed us to play around with various design elements specific to revo.js identity;
- it's located in the central area.

### The booking

First, we needed to fill in a request for booking the venue, so they could check internally that they won't have any other events planned during those dates. This request was made on January 16th 2019 and we got an answer on January 28th that the venue is available.

It took another month and a half, until March 12th, to get the actual contract signed.

### The contract

Now, this is a very funny contract. The venue was not built for commercial purposes to rent it to event organizers. It was built primarily for their own events, and occasionally, if it's free, they would also make it available for 3rd parties, like us.

So, the contract states that:
"In exceptional situations, when unexpected events occur and the locator must use the venue to fulfill legal obligations, if the event cannot be rescheduled the contract is voided and the payed amount is refunded."

Ok, we were a bit worried about this detail. But we felt comfortable with the idea that we were going to be notified in case an "exceptional situation" might occur.

### The double booking

On September 12th, 3 days after we've fully payed the invoice, and exactly 3 weeks before the event, we got a call informing us that the venue is double booked during October 3-4.

However, we were given 2 options:

1. either find another venue, which was their preferred option;
2. or remain there, and they were supposed to look for a different venue for the other event;

For us, changing the venue at that particular time meant that:

- we had to cancel lunch catering;
- we had to cancel beverages distribution;
- we had to cancel furniture services;
- and we had to throw away 2 months of planning and design of the decorative elements and rethink everything for the new location.

So, considering all these constrains, we decided to remain there and go ahead with our initial plan.

This was happening on the morning of September 16th. We got verbal warranties that everything is fine, we can have our event there without any problems.

### The pressure from above

On September 20th, 4 days later, we get another call from CJT. They've found another location for the other event, however they are not willing to move out. Apparently, things started to escalate and there was a lot of pressure from higher authorities.

At this point we have realized that we really had to move out.

Luckily, Anna from BanatIT, told us about Iulius Congress Hall, which opened recently and which could have been an alternative venue for us.

### The other event

But what is this other event, that was the "exceptional situation" which kicked us out from CJT?

It's the [7th Romania-Belgium Forum on Decentralized Cooperation](https://www.fobero.eu/en/). There are a lot of big names involved.

Also, being organized by a public institute, they kinda had priority, due to the contract. However, CJT didn't want to invoke that legal clause and kick us out. They wanted to solve this situation in a friendly manner.

But apparently, the Romanian Ambassador in Belgium, Andreea Păstârnac, refused to have their event moved in another location proposed by the CJT officials. So the only thing left to do was for us to move out.

### The aftermath

After canceling all our contracts with 3rd party services and discussing all the details regarding the new venue at Iulius Congress Hall, guess what?

We get yet another call from CJT, informing us that we can have our conference at CJT, because they'll push back and accommodate the other event in another location...

... how do you respond to that?
