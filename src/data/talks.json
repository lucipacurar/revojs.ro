While languages like C/C++ support multi-threading, JavaScript is single-threaded and this raises the question of how WebAssembly will behave.</p> <p>In this talk we will discuss the design of threads for WebAssembly, the implementation challenges in terms of security and we will see examples of how multithreading can be achieved using Web Workers.</p>",

This presentation will teach you how to guide test writing using code coverage, how to reach into the application code to test edge cases, and how to decide when to stub a network API request and when to let it go through.",

Add some magic geo data and cartographic knowledge and you are on your way to building your first mapping master piece.</p> <p>In this talk we‚Äôll go through the process of creating a web map: starting from an idea, gathering and processing the data, and finishing up with a beautiful web map visualization. No geo-knowledge required! Enthusiasm for maps will be provided in the beginning of the talk.</p>",

Join me as we take a deep dive.</p> <p>Both Junior, Intermediate and Senior developers and non-developers very often find themselves mulling over the idea of contributing to open source projects. A lot of the times this is because they might not know how to get started in contributing to open source. They either don‚Äôt believe that they are able to contribute or they think that only developers and people who are code gurus can actually contribute to open source. These are all misconceptions and the goal of this talk is to correct those misconceptions as well as give a clear outline about how to go about it for both developers and non-developers.</p>",
